# Background

My non-tech friend has a Wordpress.com installation. One day he writes me to complain
that his site is down. As the good friend I am I take a look. When I SSH into the server
I see a lot of strange files. This one file `mide.php` file caught my attention. I
decide to open it in my browser and behold the glorious Dark Shell opens before my eyes.
I felt like Moses receiving the The Ten Commandments from God himself and felt the
urge to share this Next-Gen Wordpress Server Administration Backend Tool with the world.
So here it goes.
